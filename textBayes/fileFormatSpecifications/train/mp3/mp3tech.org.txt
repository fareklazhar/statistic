Coding of Side Information
All parameters generated by the encoder are collected to enable the decoder to reproduce the
audio signal. These are the parameters that reside in the side information part of the frame.
6.8
Bitstream Formatting CRC wo
rd generation
In this final block the defined bitstream
is
generated (see Chapter
5.1
). The frame header, side
information, CRC, Huffman coded frequency lines etc are put together to form frames
. Each
one of these frames
represe
nts 1152 encoded PCM samples.

Decoding
The encoding process is quite complex and not fully described here.

Sync and Error Checking
This block receives the incoming bitstream. Every frame within the stream must be identified
by searching for the synchronization word.
I
t is not
possible
for
the following blocks to
extract
the correct
information
needed if no
frames are located
.
7.2
Huffman Decoding
& Huffman info decoding
Since Huffman coding is a variable length coding method a single codeword in the middle of
the Huffman code bits cannot be identified. The decoding must start where the codeword
starts. This in
formation is given by the Huffman info decoding block. The purpose of this
block is to provide all necessary parameters
by the Huffman decoding block to perform a
correct decoding.
Moreover
,
the Hu
ffma
n
i
nfo
d
ecoder block must insure that
576
fre
quency li
nes
are generated
regardless of how many frequency lines are described in the Hu
ffm
an
code bits
.
When fewer
than
576
frequency lines appear the Hu
ff
man
i
nfo
d
ecoding block
must initiate a zero padding
to compensate for the lack of da
ta.
7.3
Scalefactor decodin
g
This block decodes the coded scalefactors, i.e. the first part of the main data.
The scalefactor
info needed to do this is fetched from the side information. The decoded scalefactors are later
used when requantizing.
7.4
Requantizer
Here the global_gain, sca
lefactor_scale, preflag fields in the side information contributes to
restoring the frequency lines as they were generated by the MDCT block in the encoder. The
decoded scaled and quantized frequency lines output from the Huffman decoder block are
requanti
zed using the scalefactors reconstructed in the Scalefactor decoding block together
with some or all fields mentioned.
Two equations are used depending on the window used.
Both these equations are raised to the power of 4/3, which is the invers power used
in the
quantizer.
7.5
Reordering
The frequency lines generated by the
R
equantization
block are not always ordered in the same
way
.
In
the MDCT block the use of long windows prior to the transformation
,
would generate
frequency
lines ordered
fir
st by subband an
d then by frequency
.
Using short windows instead
,
w
ould
generate frequency lines ordered
fi
rst by subband
,
then by window and at last by
frequency
.
In
order to increase the e
ffi
ciency of the Hu
ff
man coding the frequency lines for
the short windows
case wer
e reordered into subbands
fi
rst
,
then frequency and at last by
window
, since the samples close in frequency are more likely to have similar values.
The reordering block will search for short windows in each of the 36 subbands. If short
windows are found t
hey are reordered.
27
7.6
Stereo Decoding
The purpose of the Stereo Processing block
is to perform the necessary pro
cessing to convert
t
he encoded stereo signal into separate left
/
right stereo sign
als.
The method used for encoding
the stereo signal can be read fr
om the mode and mode_extension
in the header of each fr
ame.
7.7
Alias Reduction
In the MDCT block within the encoder it was described that an alias reduction was applied
.
In order to obtain a correct reconstruction of the audio signal in the algorithms to come
the
aliasing artifacts must be added to the signal again
.
The alias reconstruction calculation
consists
of eight butter
fl
y calculations for each subband
,
as illustrated in
Figure
7
.
2
.
The
constants in the figure are in the specified s
tandard [8]. Aliasing is only applied to granules
unsing short blocks.

Conclusions
As assumed the audio part of the ISO MPEG
-
1 standard is very complex. It contains several
subprocedures to achieve the optimal compression.
These include the psychoa
cous
tic
model,
which determines non perceptible signals,
the filterbanks
and cosine transforms, which
effectively
handles the mapping between the frequency
-
and the time
-
domains,
scaling and
quantization of
the
sample values and finally
the
Huffman coding.
Both lossy and lossless
compression has to be combined in the process. N
either of the two alone will be able to
reduce the data to meet the compression demands.
This paper has provided the reader with an insight to the MPEG
-
1 Layer III standard and
thus
given a
good
preparation
for a future encoder/decoder implementation.
A
decoder would be
simpler
to implement
bearing in mind that
it
only has to reconstruct the bitstream and does not
need to
be concerned about
psychoacoustics or the quality of the encoded data.
Although this
paper has given
enough
information on the frame he
ader and side
information
to
be able to
locate the frames,
read the parameters and browse through them, more detailed information
regarding
the subprocedures has
to be examined to put this theory into practice.
The MPEG
-
1
specification [8] is a good place
to start
but
additional papers will
probably be
useful
since [8]
is ambiguous in s
o
me parts and lacks details in other
parts
.
The newest version
of [
8] is
recommended where previous
typo errors
have been corrected.
