Blog Entry 	Media Player File Format Security Holes on Linux 	A frightening article on file parsing vulnerabilities in various Linux media players. I haven't seen much mention of this, but it seems to me to be quite a serious problem.
Software 	VLC media player 	VLC (initially VideoLAN Client) is a highly portable multimedia player for various audio and video formats (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, mp3, ogg, ...) as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols. It can also be used as a server to stream in unicast or multicast in IPv4 or IPv6 on a high-bandwidth network.
