Image file stored in the Portable Network Graphic () format; contains a bitmap of indexed colors and uses lossless compression, similar to a . file but without copyright limitations; commonly used to store graphics for Web images.

The format was created in response to limitations with the GIF format, primarily to increase color support and to provide an image format without a patent license. Additionally, while images only support fully opaque or fully transparent pixels, images may include an 8-bit transparency channel, which allows the image colors to fade from opaque to transparent.

images cannot be animated like images. However, the related . format can be animated. images do not provide CMYK color support because they are not intended for use with professional graphics. PNG images are now supported by most Web browsers.
